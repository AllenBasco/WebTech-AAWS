            Cebu is a province in the Philippines consisting of the Cebu Island and many other surrounding islands.
            It derived its name from the word SEBU meaning animal fat.
            It is known to be a fishing village before the Spaniards came but became industrialized through the years.
            It is now one of the most developed provinces in the Philippines, with Cebu City as the center of commerce and industry.
            Cebu City, the capital of Cebu, is considered to be the oldest city in the Philippines. 
            It is also known as the oldest settlementestablished by the Spaniards in the country. 
            Found in the island are rich traces of the Philippine history left by mostly the Spaniards.
            Among these historical sites are the Magellanâ€™s Cross found in downtown Cebu (a Christian
            cross planted by the Portuguese and Spanish explorers as ordered by Ferdinand Magellan upon
            arriving in Cebu on April 1521),the Lapu-Lapu Shrine (a 20-meter statue found in Mactan
            erected in honor of Datu Lapu-Lapu, a native leader who killed Magellan), the Colon Street
            (the oldest and the shortest national road in the Philippines), the Fort San Pedro
            the oldest military defence structure built by the Spanish and indigenous Cebuano labourers
            under the command of Miguel Lopez de Legazpi), etc.
            Through the years, Cebu became more and more industrialized. The rise of big companies,
            the trend of technology, and the innovation by the people make Cebu very progressive.
            Cebu is now the home for many BPOs and small to very large companies that contribute to
            the progression of the whole island especially Cebu City.
            Today, when one speaks of Cebu, it means relaxation, luxury, pleasure, and fun, all in one island.
            For in Cebu, everything is at stake: beautiful resorts, luxury and budget hotels, breathtaking mountains,
            amazing fun activities, myriad choice of luscious restaurants, and a lot more.</i>
