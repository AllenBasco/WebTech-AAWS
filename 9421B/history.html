            The beautiful City of Baguio, also known as the Summer Capital of the Philippines, was just one of the 31 tiny settlements, or rancherias, established at around 1846 by the early Spanish colonizers in the pine-covered highlands of the Benguet province.  Back then, the rancheria that would eventually become Baguio City  was called Kafagway, a village inhabited by the Kankana-ey and Ibaloi tribes of the Cordilleras.  Rising around 5,000 feet or 1,524 meters above sea level, Kafagway and the rest of the Benguet province was perfect for growing arabica coffee, as the Spanish settlers discovered.  The coffee trees, however, would outlast the Spanish colonizers for elsewhere in the world, something else was brewing that would change the destiny of Kafagway.

            It is interesting to note that the famous Zigzag of Kennon Road was born of an engineering error!  Engineers decided to build Kennon Road more or less parallel to the mighty Bued River.  The Americans went to work quickly and began building the road from both ends.  Then, nearly five years into the project, it became clear the ends won't meet because of differences in elevation.  The engineers twisted and turned the road to compensate for early miscalculations, producing the steep and winding ZIgzag.

            Kennon Road nevertheless remains to be the most scenic route to Baguio from the lowlands so take this route if possible.  In the Klondikes, visitors will get their first ceremonial welcome or "baptism" from the cool mountain streams gently trickling from the rocks high above onto the road below.  Further up, the Bridal Veil Falls is an awesome sight to behold.  The name says it all but you just have to see it to believe.  Don't miss the Lion's Head and the Zigzag View that comes right after the gigantic lion.  Just remember to drive slowly and safely.  You'll often find yourself driving with a wall of rock on one side and a ravine on the other.  During or immediately after heavy rains, take Marcos Highway or Quirino Highway (formerly known as Naguilian Road) instead.   Being parallel to the Bued River, Kennon Road is prone to road cuts and rockslides!  Kennon Road best exemplifies the Cordilleras:  wild and beautiful. </i>
