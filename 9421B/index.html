                           Burnham Park is centered around a man-made lake located at the heart of the city. 
                           It was named after the city's planner, Daniel Burnham. The park is a favorite place of local residents and visitors alike.
                           There are different facilities for recreation and relaxation that are available in the park.
                           You can row a boat, have a picnic, attend an outdoor concert, watch a football game, go biking, or just take a leisurely stroll around the park.
                           Burnham Park is an ideal place for taking photographs and a visitor should bring along a camera when going to the park. 
                           If in case you forget to bring a camera during your visit, there are commercial photographers in the park who can take your pictures. 
                           Pictures are usually delivered to you within just a few hours. It is best to determine and agree on the fee for the services 
                           of the photographer and the cost of the photographs before committing yourself to one.</a>

                          A ridge located at the extreme northeast side of the city, past The Mansion and Wright Park,
                          Mines View Park boasts of a spectacular view of Benguet's gold and copper mines and the Cordillera mountains.
                           The main attractions in Mines View Park nowadays would be the commercial activities such as the souvenir and silverworks stores by the park.
                           The one especially worth visiting is Rimando's, that offers the best carved artifacts, on the Gibraltar side. 
                           Tourists also have a chance to get dressed in full Cordillera regalia -- bahag, shield and spear for the men, tapis for the ladies, vests and headdresses for both.

                           The lion's head along Kennon Road is the undisputed landmark that is synonymous to Baguio City. It is commonly said that a trip to Baguio City would not be complete 
                           without taking home a souvenir photograph with the famous lion head which serves as the backdrop on Kennon Road.
                           Local and foreign tourists make it a point to stop in Camp 6 and have their photographs taken at the base of the lion head. 
                           The 40-foot high lion head, located a few kilometers from the Kennon Road view deck, was carved by a Cordillera artist from a limestone boulder. 
                           Lions Club members of Baguio City thought of creating a symbol that would proclaim the presence of the group in this mountain resort city.
                           Just beside the lion head are a few small stalls that sell woodcarving and other native handicraft. Softdrinks and light snacks are also 
                           sold to visitors who take time to stop and take a break after the 45-minute drive up Kennon Road. The vendors have enjoyed high sales since this popular landmark was constructed.
